# Plan: Overview Blog Post

**Title:** "My Social Media CLI Toolkit: 7 Tools That Work with Claude Code"

**Goal:** Introduce the social-starter-pack as a cohesive toolkit, explain the problem it solves, and drive traffic to the repo.

**Target Platforms:** neonwatty.com (primary), cross-post to dev.to

---

## Outline

### 1. Hook (2-3 paragraphs)
- The problem: Content creators spend hours on distribution
- Manual posting to multiple platforms is tedious
- AI coding assistants are great, but they need good CLI tools to interact with

### 2. The Solution: Social Starter Pack
- Brief overview: 7 CLI tools designed for AI-assisted workflows
- Key differentiator: Built specifically to work well with Claude Code and other agentic IDEs
- Not just posting—research, creation, and distribution

### 3. The Tools (one paragraph each)

| Tool | Focus | Key Command Example |
|------|-------|---------------------|
| autocomplete-cli | Keyword research | `autocomplete google "query" --expand` |
| reddit-market-research | Pain point discovery | `reddit search -s "startups" -k "need help"` |
| youtube-cli | YouTube Shorts management | `youtube upload video.mp4 --title "My Short"` |
| twitter-cli | X/Twitter posting | `twitter post "Hello!" --image pic.jpg` |
| linkedin-cli | LinkedIn posting | `linkedin post "Hello LinkedIn!"` |
| google-forms-cli | Form creation/management | `gforms create "Survey" --questions q.json` |
| mcp-server | Claude Code integration | Enables all tools via natural language |

### 4. The MCP Server: The Glue
- Explain what MCP is (briefly)
- Show how Claude Code can use all tools via natural language
- Example prompt: "Search Reddit for pain points about X, then draft a tweet about the findings"

### 5. Example Workflow
Walk through a real workflow:
1. Use `autocomplete` to find keyword ideas
2. Use `reddit-market-research` to find pain points
3. Write content based on findings
4. Post to Twitter and LinkedIn with a single Claude Code prompt

### 6. Getting Started
- Link to repo
- `make install` is all you need
- Link to individual tool docs

### 7. What's Next
- Mention demo-recorder is coming soon
- Invite contributions
- Link to "CLI is All You Need" post for philosophy
